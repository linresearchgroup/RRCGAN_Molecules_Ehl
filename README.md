RRCGAN is a deep generative model using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) combined with a Regressor to generate molecules with targeted properties. It is purely run in Python. Using GPU is necessary, otherwise running the code takes a lot!

# Overview
``RRCGAN`` is a generative GAN model designed to generate small molecules with targeted properties. ``RRCGAN``, a generative deep learning model, has been built in Keras from Tensorflow that can easily installed on personal computers. Having a GPU is recommended to accelerate each epochs of learning. The packages used in RRCGAN can be installed on all major platforms (e.g. BSD, GNU/Linux, OS X, Windows).


# System Requirements
## Hardware requirements
`RRCGAN` requires only a standard computer with GPU and enough RAM. The allocated ram of the GPU is also critical in running the code to keep the large matrices used in the training process. A GPU unit with 12GB of ram is suggested. 

## Software requirements
### Python Dependencies
`RRCGAN` mainly depends on the Python scientific stack, Keras form Tensorflow, and chemistry tools chainer chemistry and RDKit.

```
numpy
scipy
scikit-learn
pandas
seaborn
sklearn
tensorflow
matplotlib
chainer chemistry
RDKit
```

# Installation Guide:
The only challenge for running the model is to set up the Tensorflow-gpu. One should install specific version of Tensorflow and Nvidia drivers to make it work. The necessary packages and the built conda environment used is mentioned in `environment.yml`. Installing the whole packages and running Tensorflow-gpu may take 30-60 minutes. 
We primarily used Lewis Cluster from University of Missouri-Columbia for running the code. The following is the information of a PC that was tested for running the Tensorflow on GPU. 
-GPU Nvidia RTX 2080 Super, Cuda version: 10.1, cuDNN: 7.6, Tensorflow: 2.11.0

# Files Guidance
## Main models 
### directory: ./model_regular:
contains codes for the Regular model. 
1) "preprocessing.ipynb" contains the code for reading the '.csv' files from PubChemQC library. 
2) "embedding_version_0_3.ipynb" contains encoder and decoder models. 
3) "Main_model_V01.ipynb" contains the code for Regressor and GAN models. After training the AE using "embedding_version_0_3.ipynb" file, the whole architecture should be trained here. After training, the file has a section for sample generation.
### directory: ./model_transfer:
contains codes for the first iteration of Transferred model.
### directory: ./model_transfer2:
contains codes for the second iteration of Transferred model.

## Training data:
### directory: ./data/trainingsets/train_regular_pubqc130K:
contains the 130K molecules downloaded from PubChemQC library. 
### directory: ./data/trainingsets/highgap_pubqc:
contains the molecules with >= 10 (eV) gap values from PubChemQC library. 
### directory: ./data/trainingsets/highgap_outliergen_trans1:
contains the molecules with >= 10 (eV) DFT-calculated gap values as outliers of generated samples using the Regular model. 
### directory: ./data/trainingsets/highgap_outliergen_trans2:
contains the molecules with >= 10.2 (eV) DFT-calculated gap values generated by the Transfer model iteration 1.

## Samples of generated SMILES
### directory: ./experiments
contains sample generation for each regular and transferred models.

### directory: ./experiments/regular/*
contains generated samples that were used for figures such as latent space, distribution of structural features, and distribution of regular vs. two iterations of transferred models. 

## Shared functions
### directory: ./utils
contains general functions that can be imported from all the directories. 

## Demo: directory: ./Demo
It contains all needed code for training a regular RRCGAN model. It can be trained on a batch of training samples of 20K samples very fast to show the training process. All the needed training samples with their saved SMILES and one-hot encoded matrices are saved in a ‘.pickle’ file inside ./Demo/training_20K/ directory.
